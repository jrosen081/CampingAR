### Glampsite (HackBeanpot 2021 Submission)
###### Set up the perfect campsite with ease

Glampsite is an iOS app that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) to help you layout your campsite with ease, before needing to make the commitment of an arrangement.
The app allows users to place various campsite equipment such as campfires, logs, tents, tables, chairs, and more, into the augmented world, to explore these hypothetical sites. 

Users are able to move, rotate, and delete these items, and can customize the size and style of them in a separate menu. Glampsite intelligently detects people in the frame of the camera and automatically occludes them, allowing for a friend to help set up without altering the AR experience. Once the user is happy with the positioning and layout, they can then take pictures of the site as they walk around it, for later reference.
